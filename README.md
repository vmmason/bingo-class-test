Hello! If you're reading this, it means you LOVE bingo and can't wait to play, or you're grading my project for the front end web development class at Code Louisville. I decided to create a Valentine's Day themed bingo card, complete with a cute little (royalty-free) pierrot as the card background. The site is built with tablets in mind, not so much phones, and has two media queries that change the appearance of the main content of the page and the header.

The header utilizes a flexbox for its layout and changes layout/style based on the viewport size. All of the links work and take you to my github, my linkedin, and use the mailto feature. 

I built the bingo card using a grid, with a whopping 31 divs! The first row of divs has an nth child rule applied to it, and a flexbox as well. The values within the grid are generated from the bingo-generator program using multiple arrays, math.random, and the querySelector method to input the numbers into the HTML. Each time the page is loaded, a new card is created!
